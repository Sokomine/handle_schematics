name = handle_schematics
description = Use handle_schematics:build at both edges of the building you want to save. Set one to end position and use the other to save the schematic. When you place another handle_schematics:build somewhere and select a stored schematic, it will be rotated properly and be placed there (if you have creative priv) or a scaffolding structure will be placed. You can also decide to i.e. use another wood type for tree logs and wooden blocks or to replace blocks which are not available in your local world. If you placed a building somewhere where it doesn't fit, don't worry: You can even restore the original landscape.
